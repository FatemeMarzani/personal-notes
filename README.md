# About
After taking the Data Analyze course at university, I found how important it is to make data-driven decisions and how it would decrease our costs and errors. This field also needs creativity and a solution-solving mindset to ask good data questions and look for the best insight, so it never becomes a routine task. 
To become an expert in this exciting field, I need to learn many things. I will share my notes here.
Most of the notes are related to becoming a good data analyst, and some are more general.
